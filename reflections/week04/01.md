> **ðŸ“– [Callback Hell](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk4/01-Callbacks)**

## Questions

1. What are some of the signs and causes of `Callback Hell`?

Callback hell can be caused by trying to write JavaScript that executes visually from top to bottom. A sign of callback hell is }).

2. What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?

asynchronous means 'take some time' or 'happen in the future, not right now'. Callbacks allow you to know when an asynchronous task has completed. 

3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix `Callback Hell`

1- Keep code shallow: make code easy to read with descriptive function names. Don't nest functions, and keep them at the top level of the program

2- Modularize: keeping small modules doing one thing each, and assembling them into other modules that do bigger things can prevent you from entering callback hell. Use function hoisting

3- Handle every error: make your code stable, putting the first argument to the callback is an error message.
