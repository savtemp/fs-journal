## Questions

1. What is a List in C#?

A list is a generic type, and can be any type (can be a reference type such as a customer or a value type like int)

2. What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?

List Constructor, List index, list contains, List finds (all, index, last, etc) - I would most likely use them often because they serve a similar purpose to arrays. 

3. How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?

You could use List.Find, List.Contains, List.Exists, or List.FindIndex to retrieve an item from a list.
