## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

The three categories of data types are: 
- Value Type: holds a data value within its own memory space, the variables of these data types directly contain values 
- Reference Type: does not store it's value directly, it stores the address where the value is being stored, contains a pointer to another memory location that holds the data 
- Pointer Type: do not inherit from object and no conversation exists between pointer types and objects, declared with an asterisk.

2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

Value data types include: bool, byte, char, decimal, double, enum, float, int, long, sbyte, short, struct, uint, ulong, ushort. In Javascript there are only 5 types of data. 

3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?

Reference types store the address where the value is being stored, it contains a pointer to another memory location that holds the data. Value types store their data directly.
