## Questions

1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?

    The tip that I think is the most beneficial to improving my design would be to use accent borders to add color to my designs. I think I immediately go to wanting to color in full boxes and backgrounds, or adding a background image to add color to my pages - when I could create a more streamline design by adding accent colors in key areas instead.

2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

    A few resources that might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas are:
    - w3schools templates 
    - bootstrap 
    - Onepagelove is a good place to look at one page designs that are modern and clean 
    - my own favorite websites are good resource for the designs I like and gravitate towards


3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

    A well designed website that is modern, stylish and easy to use/navigate might influence people to re-visit the website, and not question its legitimacy (i.e. not using some sketchy looking scam site). If it's a website that you can purchase things on it might make the user more inclined to revisit and buy more things, especially if everything is neat, organized, and easy to find.

    Through designed alone you can convey your own personal brand, a companies brand, or even a personal/company philosophy. You could also convey that your person/company/website is organized and well thought-out which someone might think extends to the rest of your business.
