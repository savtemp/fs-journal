## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use

A Pseudo-class, such as :hover, :link, or :active which are some of the most common ones, are keywords that you can add to a selector when it meets certain conditions. A Pseudo-class can also be described as a specific characteristic of an element 

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

Specificity is defined as a built in feature of CSS that is used to determine what style rules should be applied when. Specificity tells us what property/value is the most relevant to apply to an element. Specificity is beneficial because you could have many rules targeting the same element or property at the same time, but with different values. Specificity also allows us to use the correct CSS to style an element the way we want it. 

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

If you over-utilize the !important feature you could override any other CSS you might want to use. !important can override any other declarations or inline-style from HTML.
