## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 

There are three main purposes of wire-framing: 
- Wire-framing helps the designers, stakeholders, and developers make sure that the site concept is going to be focused on the user. 
- Wire-framing helps everyone involved with the project define and understand important parts of the website and what needs to be done without using a lot of technical jargon. Important pieces and functionality of the website can be discussed between clients, designers, and developers to get a better understanding of what needs to be done. 
- Wire-framing is a cheap and easy way to create mock-ups of website ideas quickly and without having to pay a lot of money - which saves you time later in the design process. 

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

Low-fidelity wireframes: the starting points, includes basic visuals of the layout. These are useful because its can help organize your thoughts, as well as organize and rearrange how you may want things on a page to look. These can also be useful is you have several ideas and want to see which one may work better. 

Mid-fidelity wireframes: include exact visuals of the layout, and may also include higher level of details in some areas such as text styles/weights or differentiating components using shades of grey. This is useful for giving designers a better idea of what they may or may not want to make stand-out. 

High-fidelity wireframes: are very specific layouts that also include the images wanting/needing to be used or content text that will be included. This is useful in the later stages of design, and give designers and developers a much clearer idea regarding systems, interactions, etc. Is also useful  when the finished-concept is being given to a developer to code. 

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

I think that wire-frames are very much worth the time, energy, and effort. Professionally, wire-frames are extremely useful in helping communication between stakeholders, clients, designers, developers, and users - it gives everyone a quick and easy way to discuss ideas that may or may not be used later in the design process. Personally, I am a very visual person, so having the ability to have a rough idea that can be sketched low-fidelity would give me a good idea of the direction that I may want to take my design. When it gets to the high-fidelity wire-frame, having the visual of knowing what goes where, and what kind of text I want, and colors, etc. is extremely helpful in streamlining my process of coding a site.
