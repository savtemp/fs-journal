## Questions

1. In your own words, why do we use Git?

We use Git to upload and store code from a local repository (laptop) to a remote repository. Git can document changes to code that has been uploaded. Git is useful when multiple people are working on a project at the same time. If something stops working, Git can also be used to revert back to a previous working code.

2. What are the benefits of having multiple branches?

Having multiple branches allows us to work on different code in a separate branch away from the Master branch. Multiple people working on the same project can commit code without it being committed to the Master branch. Another example - if you wanted to test new or different code, you could create a Test branch, separate from the Master branch. 

3. What is the difference between Git and GitHub

Git itself is a software that stores code, can track changes, and also allows developers to work together on the same code. GitHub is a website that developers use to create and manage remote repositories.
