## Questions

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?

We used RESTfulAPI, Vue.js, Node.js to access our database and create our frontend and backend. 

2. What went well so far?

Our group has done a great job of communicating and executing tasks that need to be complete. We have worked well as a group because we all take the initiative to start and task and see it through. 

3. What would you do differently? Why?

The one thing that I would like to have done differently would have been to take a longer amount of time to plan out what we wanted to do. Really take time to conceptualize our figma, our routes, and what Id's were going to be necessary. There was a lot of design and backend things that were done on the fly because we hadn't thought out exactly what we wanted to do ahead of time.
