## Questions

1. What is a Base64 Encoded Image?

A base64 encoded image is an encoded schema used for representing binary data in a text format. It is an efficient way of encoding binary data. 

2. What are the drawbacks of using Base64 Encoding?

A downside of using base64 encoding is that it will require about 33% more space than regular strings. It will also increase the files size for more than 25% which can increase bandwidth bill and increase download time. 

3. Why are these drawbacks issues in this day and age versus in the past?

This is more of an issue today than it was before because computers and programs are expected to function more quickly and efficiently than in the past. The user experience is more important today, and using base64 encoded images can make sharing content harder.
