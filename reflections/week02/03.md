## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

- Printing statements from within your project using console.log(): this allows you to make print statements to see when and where something might be happening in your code. Useful for checking Javascript functions. 

- using 'return value': lets you get the outcome of something like a function or a true/false statement

- write directly into the console: this is a good way directly test a function if you haven't written out it's all function yet. 

2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

The Elements tab allows you to look and manipulate the HTML and CSS elements. This is useful for debugging HTML because you can make direct changes and see what they do in real time - you can do this without making any permanent changes to your index.html document (when you refresh the changes you made will go away unless you wrote them into your HTML). This is also useful for debugging because you are able to go though the pages HTML and view each element in detail to see where the issue may be. 

3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

Aside from writing something to the console (as in console.log()) - you can debug your code by either using break points or a 'debugger' keyword within your code. 

- Break points: work similar to a debugger by pausing code on the line that the function runs in. Break point will allow you to use the step-by-step functions that allow you to walk through your code one step at a time to determine what is happening or where the error may be. 

- Debugger: Pause code on the line, and allow you to check values to make sure they are assigned. Also helpful for when your code is not running as intended.
