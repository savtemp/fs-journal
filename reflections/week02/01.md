## Questions

1. What is Scope ?

Scope determines where a variable is able to be used. Variables can either be globally scoped or function/local scoped. When a variable is globally scoped a var variable is declared outside a function (outside a block): EXAMPLE - var greeter = "hey hi";. The variable greeter is globally scoped because it exists and can be accessed outside of a function. When a variable is function/local scoped a var variable is declared inside a function, and can only be accessed within that function (inside a block): EXAMPLE - function newFunction(){ var hello = "hello";}. The variable hello is function scoped because we cannot access the variable hello outside of the function. 

2. What is Hoisting ?

Hoisting is a mechanism in JavaScript that moves variables and function declarations to the top of the scope before code is executed. Var variables will be hoisted to the top of the scope. 

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

LET - let is now preferred for variable declaration. let is block scoped which means is can only be used inside curly braces {}. A variable declared with let can be updated within its scope, but cannot be re-declared within its scope - this means that when using let, since a variable only exists inside its scope, you can have the same variable name for a global scope and a function scope. let declarations can also be hoisted to the top of the scope, but let is not initialized like var which means that you have to make a declaration before you use a let variable. 

CONST - variables that are declared with const maintain constant values. const declarations are also block scoped (similar to let), and can only be accessed in the block it was declared in. const cannot be updated or re-declared which means a const variable will always be the same within it's scope. const is also like let in that const declarations are hoisted to the top but not initialized. 

VAR - var declarations are globally or function scoped. var declarations can be updated and re-declared within it's scope. var variables are hoisted to the top of the scope and initialized.
