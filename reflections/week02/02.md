## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

1 - FUNCTION DECLARATION: defines a named function, the function is hoisted to the top and can be used before it is defined.

function name(parameters){
    //statements 
}

2 - FUNCTION EXPRESSION: defines a named or anonymous function (a function with no name), not hoisted, must be defined before they are used. 

let name = function(parameters){
    //statements
}

3 - ARROW FUNCTION EXPRESSION: shorter syntax for writing function expressions, do not create a 'this' value.

let name = (parameters){
    //statements
}

2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

Parameter = is a name created and used when defining a function, are separated by commas in (). Is also a value that is passed into functions and used within the function.

Argument = is a value from the parameter that the function receives when it is invoked. 

3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?

Higher order functions are when a function uses another function as a parameter (returns a function). 

EXAMPLE: Array.prototype.map OR Array.prototype.filter
