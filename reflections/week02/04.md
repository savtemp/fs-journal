## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?

Making a plan before starting to write code allows you to organize your thoughts and processes in order to create a high-quality program. It also allows you to slow down and think about the flow of the project; thinking, researching, planning, writing, validating, and modifying. When you create a plan, you are more easy able to visualize how and where, what you are writing fits into current systems, and allows you to progress in more testable increments that have more flexibility overall.

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?

When you are stuck you can find answers by googling your problem, because chances are someone else has dealt with the same problem or a very similar problem - but it is important that if you are googling for a solution that you know what the answer means before using it. 

3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?

From this article my biggest takeaways are:

- Its important to be kind to yourself regarding taking breaks and giving yourself room to think, but also in the sense that you need to be open to making mistakes, looking at errors, and having your code reviewed - having a positive attitude can help you learn more and give you valuable input that can allow you to grow into a better programmer. 
- Write code clearly, define variables or functions using clear and obvious names so that you don't need to add a bunch of extra comments to clarify what you just wrote. 
- Question everything - always question whether something can be made better, or if there is a better solution to the problem being worked on. Don't add to messy code, question its use and potentially add in a way that makes it better or more clear. 
- Keep things organized and plan ahead - organization and planning are important to have readable code, don't just code for you, also code for the person after you.
