## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

This week I implemented documentation throughout my code on my project in order to remember what each function was going to do. I also made note of different sections that did different things so that I was better able to organize my code. 

2. What went well this week?

Being able to bounce ideas of my peers was a great resource when trying to think of a user friendly accessible design. 

3. What would you do differently?

I would probably do a better job of planning out my design and when/where to click to provide a more user friendly experience
