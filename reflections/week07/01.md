## Questions

1. What is Pair Programming? What are the roles and how do they work?

Pair programming is when two programmers share a single computer. One person 'drives' or types out the code, while the other person 'navigates' or gives directions on what to write, while also looking up references or examples. 

2. What are some benefits of Pair Programming?

Benefits of Pair programming:
- increase in code quality because pairs are better able to communicate details of the task 
- Reduces the risk of errors, two sets of eyes being better than one 
- Diffusion of knowledge, if one partner knows something that the other doesn't its a good opportunity to learn 
- Junior developers are able to learn more from more experienced developers, and able to pick up new techniques 
- Better focus between two people rather than one, can keep each other focused on the task 

3. What are some drawbacks to Pair Programming?

Drawbacks to pair programming:
- Doesn't work if both partners are not engaged in the task 
- when pair programming is poorly applied it can cost more 
- if partners don't talk to each other then it won't work as one person would be doing both jobs
- if the partners don't work well together it could cause greater issues between both people
