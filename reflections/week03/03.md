## Questions

1. What are the two common operations that we will set in the handler?

Two common operations that we will set in the handler are:

- get: get performs an operation on the object to get a value
- set: set performs an operation to set a new key to the object

2. What do you have to make sure you are doing with every Get to ensure the value does not become `undefined`?

With every get, you need to make sure that you are passing a parameter (value stored in the key in the object - pass two parameters: the object and the property being accessed).

3. What are some of the benefits of the proxy object that we are using in our structure for applications?

Some of the benefits of the proxy object are preventing users from accessing properties when they shouldn't be. A proxy object enables you to create a proxy for another object, that can intercept and redefine the operation for that object.
