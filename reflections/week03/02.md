## Questions

1. What is the purpose of Encapsulation?

The purpose of encapsulation is to have the ability to bundle data and the methods that act on data, and restrict access to them from outside the bundle. 

2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?

Some of the problems with closures and underscore prefix included breaking changes (when new programmers aren't aware of the convention), leaked implementation details (potentially creating dependencies on data structure that may cause code breaks), expanded attack surface for hackers (hackers can exploit API), and self-documenting code (relying on users to know what the conventions mean and that you don't intent for them to use it).


3. How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?

To declare private data we use encapsulation. We can use privilege method which allows us to access private data inside the containing functions scope. When you use a privileged function you have referenced-based access to the containing functions variables.
