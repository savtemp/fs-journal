## Questions

1. What problem does using exports solve?

using exports allows you to directly reference or include one JavaScript file in another. This solved the problem of using multiple HTML script tags which affected page performance. 

2. How does export differ from export default?

export: allows you to concatenate all scripts in one main script, allowing other modules to import them. Export also exposes public variables, functions and classes. 

export default: exports values 

3. What is a benefit of using the Module System?

A few benefits of using modules are:
- being able to split code into smaller files for more self-contained functionality 
- you can write multiple scripts that overall increase performance
- modules can get rid of naming conflicts (there can be 2 of the same function in different modules that won't clash with each other)
- Overall modules can help you organize your code better
