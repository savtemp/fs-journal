> **ðŸ“– [The Observer Pattern](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk3/04-Observer-Pattern)**

## Questions

1. What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?

The observer pattern looks at solving updates to a page in response to certain events, such as when there are many elements on a page that need to be in sync or during client side scripting. xs

2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?

Three mechanisms of the observer pattern are:
- The subscribe method: adds new observable events
- The unsubscribe method: removes observable events
- The broadcast method: executes all events with bound data

3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.

The bcw-template uses proxy objects and observer pattern to manage and update the dom by keeping all the data synced with many different elements on the page. The two combined work together to update the page when the user interacts with it, and changes/updates the data when this happens.
