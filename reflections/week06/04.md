## Questions

1. What is a nested route?

Nested routes allow more complex user interfaces with components nested inside of each other. 

2. When might you use a nested route? (other than the provided example)

You would use a nested route when you have repeated information that needs to be rendered on different pages. Instead of writing out a template for each part in the different pages, you create a component that can be reused in different areas. 

3. Can you pass parameters through nested routes? When might you use them?

You can pass parameters through nested routes with the use of props. You would do this when you want your child component to have access to data from the parent component.
