## Questions

1. What is Component based architecture?

Component based architecture is a method for encapsulating individual pieces of a larger user interface, called components, into self-sustaining, independent, microsystems

2. What are some benefits of Component based architecture?

Some benefits include: 
- components each having their own interface means that it can make its own calls to the server and updates its interface, and because a component is independent, it can do refresh without affecting the other components or the entire UI 
- components can allow maximum functionality and performance 
- the organization is clearer than MVC which allows developers to spend less time trying to find which functions pertain to which part of an applications UI 
- components are reusable which means you can have 2 of the same independent component, each doing different things but looking and acting similarly 

3. What are some drawbacks to Component based architecture?

Some drawbacks of CBA include:
- hindered readability: components encapsulate responsibilities all in one space which can make it harder to read
- potential to over-engineer: you can end up engineers every single aspect of a UI as a component, it can end up dictating the entire structure of an application when it shouldn't
