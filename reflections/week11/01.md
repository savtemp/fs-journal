## Questions

1. What does Inheritance accomplish for us in C#?

Inheritance allows the developer to describe a relationship between wo classes - the derived class(child class) and the base class(parent class), where the derived class inherits from the base class. 

2. How does Member inheritance work in C#? Does a class inherit all members of the base class?

Since a derived class is an instance of a base class, it will contain everything the base class contains. Visibility depends on accessibility.

3. How does accessibility affect inheritance?

The declared accessibility of a base class does not control whether the member is inherited - inheritance extends to any member that isn't an instance constructor. An inherited member may not be accessible in a derived type.
