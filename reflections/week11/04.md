## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

Concerns:
- Many-to-many relationship when writing the backend
- Many-to-many relationship when writing the frontend 
- Hitting all accessibility requirements 

Time Management:
- Start with the main set of backend postman tests, get those completed and then start to front-end to build out most of the application -> then go back to the backend to finish the rest of the postman tests 
- Time-box issues -> only take 15 minutes on a problem that I am really stuck on, before either asking for help if available or moving on to something else
