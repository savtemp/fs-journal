## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`

Primary Key: focuses on the uniqueness of the table - it assures the value in the specific column is unique. 
Foreign Key: is used to build a relationship between two tables - table allows only one primary key.

2. What is an `Alias`?

Alias: used to a give a temporary name to a table or column in a table for the purposes of a particular query - it works as a nickname for expressing the tables or column names, it can make the query shorter and neater, and it is useful when the table or column name is not user-friendly in real-time. 

3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)

```
SELECT 
  dp.* AS doctorsPatients
  d.*
  p.*
FROM doctorsPatients dp
  JOIN doctors d ON dp.doctorId = d.id
  JOIN patients p ON dp.patientId = p.id
WHERE f.id = @id
