## Questions

1. In simple terms what is timeboxing?

Time-boxing is a time management strategy that includes assigning fixed time to activities or tasks in advanced and then sticking with that time assignment. Each time-box serves as a deadline for when the task or activity needs to be completed. 

2. What three strategies will you implement and how?

Three strategies that I will implement and how:
- Knowing my 'golden hour' : I will have to work on knowing when I am the most productive in order to schedule most of my tasks during this time. Once I know what my golden hour is I will try to schedule the majority of my tasks in that window to maximize productivity 
- Prioritization : Being able to prioritize meaningful tasks and non-essential tasks is something I struggle with, to implement prioritization I will apply time-boxing only to activities or tasks that are considered high priority, I will do this by taking time at the end of the night to plan out my three most important tasks for the following day
- Swallowing the frog : I am pretty good at scheduling the 'worst' task as the first thing I try to do, but to implement this further adding time-boxing to the 'worst' task in order to help me feel more accomplished and motivated to work on more tasks later in the day. I could do this by keeping the top spot in my to-do list reserved for the hardest or 'worst' task 

3. Give an example of when you would have benefitted from timeboxing and how? 

I think I would have benefitted from time-boxing in college while I was taking some of the harder courses in my degree. I would always start working on tasks that I didn't want to do, and start to feel unmotivated the more challenging and longer time it took, which prevented me from starting the easier tasks that I also had planned for that day. If I had made time-boxes for those more difficult tasks I could've made the most of the time and not felt like the work was dragging on forever.
