## Questions

1. What are the three types of relationships?

The three types of relationships are: 
- One-to-One (1:1) - which describes a relationship between two entities, one embeds the relationship, the second links to a document in a separate collection (author lives at a single address, address only contains one author)
- One-to-Many (1:N) - which describes a relationship where one side can have more than one relationship, and the reverse relationship can only be single-sided (blog has comments, comments only relate to a single blog)
- Many-to-Many (N:M) - which describes a relationship between two entities that both might have many relationships between each other (book written by many authors, or author having written many books)

2. What are the benefits of the traditional `linking` of relationships instead of `Embedding`

An advantage of traditional 'linking' of relationships rather than 'embedding' is that linking will not grow the original document array and in turn will not run the document max size, it is also easier to return things. 

3. What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?

Some challenges that are faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship includes deciding how to map that data in order to maintain the relationship between the many types - this might include making many different id's which could cause confusion and difficult to manage.
