## Questions

1. What are the three types of relationships?

The three types of relationships are: 
- One-to-One (1:1) - which describes a relationship between two entities, one embeds the relationship, the second links to a document in a separate collection (author lives at a single address, address only contains one author)
- One-to-Many (1:N) - which describes a relationship where one side can have more than one relationship, and the reverse relationship can only be single-sided (blog has comments, comments only relate to a single blog)
- Many-to-Many (N:M) - which describes a relationship between two entities that both might have many relationships between each other (book written by many authors, or author having written many books)

2. What are the benefits of the traditional `linking` of relationships instead of `Embedding`



3. What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?
