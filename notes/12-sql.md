# MVC

SQL
- One-to-One (1:1) - which describes a relationship between two entities, one embeds the relationship, the second links to a document in a separate collection (author lives at a single address, address only contains one author)

- One-to-Many (1:N) - which describes a relationship where one side can have more than one relationship, and the reverse relationship can only be single-sided (blog has comments, comments only relate to a single blog)

- Many-to-Many (N:M) - which describes a relationship between two entities that both might have many relationships between each other (book written by many authors, or author having written many books)
